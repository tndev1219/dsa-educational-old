                            For the first year of your babyâ€™s life, your doctor will need to monitor the amount
                            of Gal-1p in their blood at 3 months and 9 months after beginning a
                            galactose-restricted diet. This is because children and adults with Galactosemia
                            will have high levels of Gal-1p in their blood.
