                        The decision to stop breastfeeding your newborn isn’t a healthy one. And while
                        breastfeeding is one way to build a connection with your baby, it’s not the only way.

                And if you find yourself feeling guilty, anxious, or disappointed about stopping
                breastfeeding—know that it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. Give yourself permission to feel
                your feelings, the good and the bad. Mothers who have had to stop breastfeeding early may be
                more likely to experience postpartum depression. If you’re feeling overwhelmed and need some
                help, Postpartum Support International has resources to help.
